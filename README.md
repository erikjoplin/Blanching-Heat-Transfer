# Blanching-Heat-Transfer-FEA

Calculates the temperature profile achieved through blanching profile based on a forward time central space (FTCS) scheme and finite element 1-D model to determine the effect on potentially harmful microorangism colonies. This is used to model and calculate log reduction of microorganisms based on temperature, time, and radius of produce (assumes spherical produce).
